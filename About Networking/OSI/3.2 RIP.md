# RIP (Routing Information Protocol)

- ## Distance-Vector Routing Algorithm:

  RIP uses a simpler distance-vector routing algorithm. Each router in a RIP network maintains a routing table with information about known networks and their "hop count"

- ## Hop Count:

  RIP routers use hop count as their metric to determine the best path to a destination network. RIP selects the route with the fewest hops, which may not always be the fastest or most efficient path.

- ## Periodic Updates:

  RIP routers periodically send updates containing their routing tables to their neighbors. These updates are sent every 30 seconds by default.

- ## Maximum Hop Count:

  RIP has a maximum hop count limit of 15. If a route exceeds this limit, it is considered unreachable.

- ## No Support for VLSM:

  RIP is a classful routing protocol and does not support variable-length subnet masks (VLSM) or route summarization.

  # VLSM

  is especially useful when you have limited IP address space, and you want to allocate IP addresses more efficiently. It enables you to create subnets of various sizes based on the specific needs of each subnet. For example, you can allocate more IP addresses to subnets with a large number of hosts and fewer IP addresses to subnets with fewer hosts.

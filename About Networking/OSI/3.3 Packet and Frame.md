1. ### Layer in OSI Model:

   Packets are associated with the Network Layer (Layer 3) in the OSI model.

2. ### Unit of Data:

   A packet is a unit of data that contains both the actual data being transmitted and the network layer header. The header includes critical information like source and destination IP addresses.

## Frame:

1. ### Layer in OSI Model:

   Frames are associated with the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) in the OSI model.

2. ### Unit of Data:

   A frame is a unit of data that contains both the actual data being transmitted (often referred to as the payload) and the data link layer header and trailer. The header and trailer include source and destination MAC addresses, error-checking information (e.g., CRC or checksum), and control information.

# Switch and Hub

Switches and hubs are both networking devices used to connect multiple devices in a local area network (LAN).

## Switch:

1.  ### Operational Intelligence:

    A switch operates at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model and is considered a smarter networking device.

    It uses MAC addresses to make forwarding decisions.

2.  ### Packet Forwarding:

    Switches examine incoming data packets and forward them only to the specific port where the destination device is located, based on the MAC address.

    This targeted forwarding reduces network congestion and improves network performance.

3.  ### Collision Domain:

    Each port on a switch has its collision domain, which means that devices connected to different switch ports can transmit simultaneously without causing collisions.

## Hub:

1.  ### Operational Intelligence:

    A hub operates at the Physical Layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model and is a simpler networking device.

    It broadcasts incoming data packets to all connected devices without intelligence about the destination.

2.  ### Packet Forwarding:

    Hubs do not make forwarding decisions; they blindly broadcast incoming data packets to all connected devices, regardless of whether the data is intended for a specific device.

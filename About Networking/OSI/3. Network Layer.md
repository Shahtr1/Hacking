## Function

The Network Layer is responsible for routing data packets across different networks or subnets. It determines the best path for data transmission.

## Key Concepts:

- ### IP Addresses:
  Internet Protocol addresses provide logical addressing for devices on a network.
- ### Routing:
  Routing algorithms, such as OSPF and BGP, determine the most efficient paths for data to travel.
- ### Subnetting:
  Dividing a network into smaller, more manageable segments.
- ### IPv4 and IPv6

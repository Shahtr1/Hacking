# Protocols of VPNs

1.  ## PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol):

    PPTP is one of the earliest VPN protocols and is relatively easy to set up.

    It provides basic encryption and authentication but is considered less secure than newer protocols.

2.  ## L2TP/IPsec (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol with IPsec):

    L2TP is often used in combination with the IPsec protocol to enhance security.

    It provides stronger encryption and authentication compared to PPTP.

    L2TP/IPsec is suitable for remote access and site-to-site VPNs.

3.  ## SSTP (Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol):

    SSTP is a Microsoft-developed VPN protocol designed for Windows environments.

    It uses SSL/TLS encryption for secure communication and is known for its security features.

    SSTP is well-suited for secure remote access in Windows-based networks.

4.  ## IKEv2/IPsec (Internet Key Exchange Version 2 with IPsec):

    IKEv2 is a modern protocol that is known for its stability and security.

    It supports seamless roaming between network connections (e.g., Wi-Fi to cellular).

    IKEv2/IPsec is suitable for mobile devices and remote access scenarios.

5.  ## OpenVPN:

    OpenVPN is an open-source and highly configurable VPN protocol.

    It offers strong security through SSL/TLS encryption and supports various authentication methods.

    OpenVPN is versatile and can be used for remote access, site-to-site VPNs, and is compatible with multiple platforms.

6.  ## WireGuard:

    WireGuard is a relatively new and lightweight VPN protocol designed for simplicity and speed.

    It is known for its efficient performance and strong security.

    WireGuard is gaining popularity for remote access and site-to-site VPNs.

7.  ## SSL/TLS VPN (Web VPN):

    SSL/TLS VPNs are often referred to as "Web VPNs" because they use SSL/TLS to secure web-based communication.

    They are accessible via a web browser and do not require client software installation.

    SSL/TLS VPNs are suitable for remote access to web applications and services.

8.  ## Hybrid VPN:

    Hybrid VPNs combine different VPN technologies to create a flexible and robust solution.

    For example, a hybrid VPN might use SSL/TLS VPN for secure web access and IPsec for site-to-site connectivity.

9.  ## Mesh VPN:

    Mesh VPNs connect multiple devices or sites in a mesh topology, allowing any node to communicate with any other node directly.

    They are often used for creating decentralized and resilient networks.

10. ## Mobile VPN:

    Mobile VPNs are designed for mobile devices and provide secure connectivity, especially when devices switch between different networks (e.g., Wi-Fi to cellular).

# AES

AES, which stands for Advanced Encryption Standard, is a widely used symmetric encryption algorithm

- ## Symmetric Encryption:

  AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm, which means it uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. The sender and receiver must share a secret key.

- ## Block Cipher:

  AES operates on fixed-size blocks of data. The most common block size is 128 bits (16 bytes), but AES also supports 192-bit and 256-bit block sizes. Each block is treated independently during encryption.

- ## Rounds:
  AES encryption consists of multiple rounds of transformations applied to the data. The number of rounds depends on the key length: 10 rounds for 128-bit keys, 12 rounds for 192-bit keys, and 14 rounds for 256-bit keys.

## AES Encryption Process:

1.  ### Key Expansion:

    The original encryption key is derived from a user-provided key through a process called "key expansion." This key expansion process involves generating a series of round keys from the original key to be used in the encryption rounds.

    - #### Key Expansion Overview:

      The original encryption key is referred to as the "main key" or "master key." It can be 128, 192, or 256 bits in length, depending on the desired level of security (AES-128, AES-192, or AES-256).

      The key expansion process generates a set of round keys, one for each round of encryption (e.g., 10 rounds for AES-128, 12 rounds for AES-192, and 14 rounds for AES-256).

      Each round key is derived from the previous round key, with additional operations applied to introduce complexity and ensure that the round keys are unique.

    - #### Key Expansion Steps:

      The key expansion process typically involves the following steps:

      - ##### Initial Round Key:

        The main key is used to generate the initial round key, often referred to as "Round Key 0."

      - ##### b. Word Generation:

        The main key is divided into "words" (chunks) of data, with the size of each word corresponding to the block size of the AES variant being used (e.g., 32 bits for AES-128).

      - ##### c. Key Schedule:

        The key schedule consists of a series of operations that transform the previous round key into the next round key. This includes operations such as:

        - ###### Substitution:

          Replacing bytes or bits in the key with values from lookup tables.

        - ###### Bitwise Operations:

          Applying XOR (exclusive OR) and other bitwise operations.

        - ##### Circular Shifts:

          Shifting bytes or words to the left or right.

      - #### d. Round Constants:

        In each round of key expansion, a round constant value is introduced to add variation to the round key. These constants are derived from a predefined mathematical formula

    - #### Resulting Round Keys:

      After the key expansion process is complete, you have a set of round keys, including the initial round key (Round Key 0) and the subsequent round keys (Round Key 1, Round Key 2, and so on) up to the final round key used for encryption.

    - #### Encryption Rounds:

      During the encryption process, each round key is used in a specific round of encryption. The encryption rounds use both the round key and the data block to perform a series of operations that scramble the data.

      The complexity of the key expansion process makes it computationally infeasible for an attacker to reverse-engineer the original encryption key from the round keys, even if they have access to the round keys.

- 2. ### Ciphertext:

  After all rounds are completed, the resulting data is the ciphertext, which is sent to the recipient.

## AES Decrytpion Process:

AES decryption is essentially the reverse of encryption. The ciphertext and the same secret key are used to recover the original plaintext.

1.  ### Key Expansion (Inverse):

    Before decryption can begin, the decryption process must generate the round keys, just as in encryption. However, the key expansion process is applied in reverse order. The round keys are derived from the original encryption key but are used in reverse order during decryption.

2.  ## Initial Round (Inverse):

    In the first round of decryption, the ciphertext block is combined with the final round key using an "AddRoundKey" operation. This step is similar to the initial round in encryption but is performed in reverse.

3.  ## Rounds (Inverse):

    The remaining decryption rounds are applied in reverse order compared to encryption. Each round involves four main operations, which are the inverse of the corresponding encryption operations:

    - ### InverseSubBytes:

      Each byte of the block is replaced with a corresponding byte from an inverse S-box lookup table.

    - ### InverseShiftRows:

      The bytes in each row of the block are shifted to the right, in contrast to the left shifts used in encryption.

    - ### InverseMixColumns:

      Each column of the block is mixed using an inverse mathematical transformation.

    - ### AddRoundKey:
      The round key for the current round is combined with the block data using bitwise XOR.

4.  ## Final Round (Inverse):

The final round of decryption is similar to the regular rounds but omits the "InverseMixColumns" operation.

5. ## Recovered Plaintext:

After all rounds are completed in reverse order, the resulting data is the recovered plaintext. It should match the original plaintext that was encrypted.

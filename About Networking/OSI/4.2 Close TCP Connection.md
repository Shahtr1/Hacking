# Closing a TCP Connection

1. ## Four-Way Handshake (Full Duplex Close):

This method is the standard way to close a TCP connection. It involves a four-step process:

- ### Step 1 (Client to Server):

  The client sends a TCP segment with the FIN (Finish) flag set to 1, indicating that it wants to close its side of the connection.

- ### Step 2 (Server to Client):

  Upon receiving the FIN from the client, the server acknowledges it with an ACK. The server may still have data to send to the client, so it can continue to transmit data segments until it's ready to close its side of the connection.

- ### Step 3 (Server to Client):

  When the server is ready to close its side of the connection, it sends a TCP segment with the FIN flag set to 1 to the client.

- ### Step 4 (Client to Server):

  The client acknowledges the server's FIN with an ACK. At this point, the TCP connection is fully closed.

2. ## Half-Close (One-Way Close):

In some cases, one side of the connection may want to close its send channel while still allowing the other side to send data. This is known as a half-close.

The side initiating the half-close sends a FIN, but it can still receive data.

- ### Step 1 (Client to Server for Half-Close):

  The client sends a TCP segment with the FIN flag set to 1, indicating that it wants to close its send channel but can still receive data.

- ### Step 2 (Server to Client):

  The server acknowledges the FIN from the client, indicating that it received the request for a half-close.

  The other side can continue sending data until it's ready to perform a full close, at which point it will initiate the standard four-way handshake.

It's important to note that the TCP connection is considered fully closed when both sides have exchanged FIN and ACK segments, as shown in the four-way handshake. This ensures that all data has been reliably transmitted and received.

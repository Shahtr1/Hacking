## Function

The Data Link Layer is responsible for the reliable and error-free transmission of data between directly connected nodes. It breaks data into frames and adds necessary addressing and error-checking information.

## Key Concepts

1. ### MAC Addresses:

   Medium Access Control (MAC)
   Its primary goal is to manage and coordinate how devices on a shared medium can transmit data without causing conflicts or collisions.

   - #### Addressing:

     MAC addresses are unique hardware addresses assigned to network interface cards (NICs).
     Ethernet MAC addresses, for example, are 48-bit values typically written in hexadecimal notation.

   - #### Frame Creation:

     The MAC layer encapsulates data received from the Network Layer into frames for transmission. A frame typically includes source and destination MAC addresses, control information, and the actual data payload.

   - #### Medium Access Methods:

     - ##### CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection):

       This method was used in early Ethernet networks. Devices listen to the network medium to determine if it is idle before attempting to transmit. If a collision is detected (two devices transmitting simultaneously), they back off and retry later.

     - ##### CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance):
       This method is used in Wi-Fi networks. Devices use a process to avoid collisions before they occur by sending a Request to Send (RTS) and Clear to Send (CTS) sequence.

2. ### Frame:

   A frame is a unit of data at this layer, containing data, control information, and error-checking bits.

3. ### Switching:
   Data link layer switches operate at this layer to forward frames based on MAC addresses.

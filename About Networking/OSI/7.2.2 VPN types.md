# Types of VPNs

1. ## Remote Access VPN:

- ### Overview:

  Remote access VPNs enable individual users or remote workers to securely connect to a corporate network from outside the office. They are commonly used by employees working from home, traveling, or accessing company resources while away from the physical office.

- ### How It Works:

  When a remote user initiates a connection to the corporate network, they typically use a VPN client application provided by the organization. This client establishes a secure tunnel to the corporate VPN gateway. The user is authenticated, and data traffic is encrypted and tunneled through the internet to reach the corporate network.

2. ## Site-to-Site VPN:

- ### Overview:

  Site-to-site VPNs, also known as network-to-network VPNs, connect entire networks or LANs (Local Area Networks) together over a public network, such as the internet. They are commonly used by businesses with multiple office locations to create a unified private network.

- ### How It Works:

  Each site involved in the VPN has a dedicated VPN gateway or router. These gateways establish secure tunnels with each other to create a virtual network connection. Data traffic between the sites is encrypted and transmitted securely over the public network.

3. ## Client-to-Site VPN (Road Warrior VPN):

- ### Overview:

  Client-to-site VPNs, sometimes referred to as "road warrior" VPNs, allow individual clients or devices to securely connect to a corporate network. These clients can be laptops, smartphones, or other devices.

- ### How It Works:

  Users install a VPN client application or use built-in VPN functionality on their devices. They initiate connections to the corporate VPN gateway, authenticate themselves, and establish secure tunnels. Data traffic between the client and the corporate network is encrypted and transmitted securely.

4. ## Intranet vs. Extranet VPN:

- ### Intranet VPN:

  Intranet VPNs connect devices or networks within the same organization. They enable secure communication and data sharing among employees and departments within the organization.

- ### Extranet VPN:

  Extranet VPNs extend connections to trusted external entities, such as partners, suppliers, or clients. They provide secure access to specific resources or data for authorized external users while maintaining network separation.

- ### Use Cases:

  Intranet VPNs enhance internal communication and data sharing, while extranet VPNs facilitate collaboration with trusted external parties without compromising security.

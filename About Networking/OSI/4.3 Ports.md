# Ports

TCP and UDP ports are limited to a range of 65,536 (from 0 to 65,535) because of the way port numbers are represented in the Transport Layer of the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP).

This limit is a result of the 16-bit field used to represent port numbers in the TCP and UDP headers.

Here's why there are 65,536 possible ports:

- ## 16-Bit Port Field:

  In both TCP and UDP headers, there is a 16-bit field reserved for the source and destination port numbers. A 16-bit field can represent values from 0 to 2^16 - 1, which is 65,535. Port 0 is reserved and cannot be used, leaving a total of 65,535 usable ports.

- ## Reserved Ports:

  A few port numbers are reserved for specific purposes, such as port 80 for HTTP, port 443 for HTTPS, port 25 for SMTP, and so on. These well-known ports are used for commonly recognized services. Additionally, some port numbers are reserved for various purposes, such as ephemeral ports for temporary client-server communication.

- ## Dynamic Port Allocation:
  In many operating systems, when a client initiates a connection to a server, it uses a dynamically allocated ephemeral port from a range, often starting from 49,152 to 65,535. These ports are used temporarily for communication between the client and server. After the communication session ends, these ports are typically released and made available for future use.

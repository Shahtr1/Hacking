# Modulation, short for "modulation-demodulation"

Modulation is used to "embed" data into a carrier signal, making it suitable for long-distance transmission and subsequent "demodulation" at the receiver to retrieve the original information.

Basic Components of Modulation:

1. ### Carrier Signal:

   The carrier signal is a high-frequency signal that provides the "envelope" within which the lower-frequency information signal is embedded.

2. ### Information Signal (Baseband Signal):
   This is the signal containing the actual data or information that needs to be transmitted. It is typically a lower-frequency signal (compared to the carrier) that represents the information to be conveyed, such as audio, video, or digital data.

## Types of Modulation:

1. ### Amplitude Modulation (AM):

   #### Modulation Property:

   In AM, the amplitude (strength) of the carrier signal is varied in proportion to the instantaneous amplitude of the information signal.

   #### Use Cases:

   AM is commonly used in radio broadcasting to transmit audio signals.

2. ### Frequency Modulation (FM):

   #### Modulation Property:

   In FM, the frequency of the carrier signal is altered in response to the instantaneous amplitude of the information signal.

   #### Use Cases:

   FM is widely used in FM radio and some television broadcasting due to its resistance to amplitude variations and noise.

3. ### Phase Modulation (PM):

   #### Modulation Property:

   In PM, the phase (timing) of the carrier signal is changed based on the information signal's instantaneous amplitude.

   #### Use Cases:

   PM is used in various digital communication systems, such as phase-shift keying (PSK) for transmitting digital data.

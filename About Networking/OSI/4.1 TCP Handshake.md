# TCP Handshake

- ## Client to Server (Step 1 - SYN):

The client generates a TCP segment with the SYN flag set to 1 to initiate the connection.

In this segment, the client assigns its own ISN, let's call it "Client_ISN," which is a randomly chosen sequence number.

The Acknowledgment Number field in this segment is set to 0 because there is no acknowledgment yet since the connection hasn't been established.

- ## Server to Client (Step 2 - SYN-ACK):

Upon receiving the SYN segment from the client, the server prepares its response by generating a separate TCP segment.

In this response segment, the server assigns its own ISN, let's call it "Server_ISN," which is also a randomly chosen sequence number.

The Acknowledgment Number field in this segment is set to the client's ISN (Client_ISN) + 1, indicating the next expected sequence number from the client.

The server acknowledges the client's sequence number by setting the Acknowledgment Number field to Client_ISN + 1.

- ## Client to Server (Step 3 - ACK):

Upon receiving the SYN-ACK response from the server, the client generates the final acknowledgment (ACK) segment to complete the handshake.

In this ACK segment, the client acknowledges the server's ISN (Server_ISN) by setting the Acknowledgment Number field to Server_ISN + 1.

The client assigns its own ISN for future data segments.
So, there are indeed two separate ISNs used in the TCP handshake: one for the client and one for the server.
These ISNs are used to keep track of the sequence numbers for data segments exchanged between the two parties after the connection is established.

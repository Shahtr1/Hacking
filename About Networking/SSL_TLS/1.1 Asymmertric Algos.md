# Diffie-Hellman (DH) Key Exchange & RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)

## Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange:

- ### Purpose:

  Diffie-Hellman is primarily used for secure key exchange between two parties, often during the initial setup of a secure communication channel. Its main goal is to allow two parties to agree on a shared secret (symmetric key) over an insecure channel without ever transmitting the shared key itself.

- ### Key Exchange Process:

  The DH key exchange process involves the following steps:

  - Both parties (Alice and Bob) agree on public parameters (a large prime number and a primitive root modulo).

  - Each party independently generates a private key.

  - They perform a series of mathematical calculations using their private keys and the public parameters to compute a shared secret (the same result at both ends) without transmitting the secret itself.

  - The shared secret can then be used as a symmetric encryption key for secure communication.

- ### Security Strength:
  DH key exchange provides forward secrecy, meaning that even if an attacker intercepts the exchanged information, they cannot retroactively decrypt past communication. The security relies on the difficulty of solving the discrete logarithm problem.

## RSA Encryption:

- ### Purpose:

  RSA is a versatile asymmetric encryption algorithm used for encryption, digital signatures, and secure key exchange. While it can be used for key exchange, it's often less efficient and not the primary choice for this purpose.

- ### Key Exchange with RSA:

  In RSA-based key exchange, one party (usually the server) generates an RSA key pair (public and private keys). The server's public key is used for encrypting a pre-master secret sent by the client. The server then decrypts this pre-master secret using its private key to establish a shared symmetric key.

- ### Security Strength:
  RSA security relies on the difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers. It is widely considered secure when using sufficiently long key lengths

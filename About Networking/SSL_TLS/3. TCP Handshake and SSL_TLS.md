# What happens first SSL/TLS or TCP handshake?

The SYN-ACK handshake in TCP and the RSA key exchange with CAs in SSL/TLS occur at different stages of establishing a connection and serve distinct purposes.

- ## TCP Three-Way Handshake (SYN-ACK):

  The TCP three-way handshake is initiated first when the client wants to establish a basic network connection with the server.

  It consists of the following steps:

  - 1.  The client sends a SYN (synchronize) packet to the server, requesting the establishment of a connection.
  - 2.  The server responds with a SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge) packet, indicating its willingness to establish the connection and acknowledging the client's request.

  - 3. The client sends an ACK (acknowledge) packet back to the server, confirming the establishment of the connection.

- ## SSL/TLS Handshake with RSA Key Exchange (HTTPS):

  - After the TCP connection is established, if the client intends to establish a secure and encrypted connection (e.g., for HTTPS), it initiates the SSL/TLS handshake.

  - The SSL/TLS handshake includes several steps, one of which involves the RSA key exchange (or other key exchange methods) for securing the connection.

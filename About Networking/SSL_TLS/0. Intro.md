# SSL/TLS Encryption

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and its successor TLS (Transport Layer Security) are cryptographic protocols used to secure communications over computer networks.

1. ## Encryption Layers:

   SSL/TLS encryption operates at the transport layer of the OSI model. It ensures the confidentiality and integrity of data during transmission.

2. ## Handshake Process:

   When a client and server establish a secure connection, they undergo an SSL/TLS handshake. During this process, they negotiate encryption algorithms, exchange cryptographic keys, and verify each other's identity using digital certificates.

3. ## Key Exchange:

   SSL/TLS encryption relies on a combination of symmetric and asymmetric encryption. Symmetric encryption is used for the bulk of data transmission because it's faster, while asymmetric encryption is used for securely exchanging session keys.

4. ## Certificate Authorities (CAs):

   SSL/TLS relies on trusted third parties called Certificate Authorities. CAs issue digital certificates that verify the identity of websites or servers. Browsers and clients use these certificates to ensure they are connecting to legitimate and trusted entities.

5. ## Forward Secrecy:

   Many modern SSL/TLS implementations support forward secrecy, which ensures that even if an attacker obtains encryption keys in the future, they cannot decrypt past communication. This enhances security.

6. ## Common Uses:

   SSL/TLS encryption is used in various applications, including securing web traffic (HTTPS), email transmission (SMTPS, IMAPS), VPNs (like OpenVPN), and secure file transfers (e.g., SFTP).

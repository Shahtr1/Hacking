# Diffie-Hellman key exchange

Imagine you want to send secret messages to your friend, but you're worried about someone intercepting your messages. You need a way to share a secret key with your friend without anyone else knowing it. This is where the Diffie-Hellman key exchange comes in.

Here's how it works, step by step:

- ## Step 1: Public Parameters
  Both you and your friend agree on some public numbers, which everyone can know. These numbers include a large prime number (let's call it "P") and a smaller number (let's call it "G").
- ## Step 2: Private Keys
  You and your friend each pick your own secret number. This secret number is kept completely private and should never be shared. Let's call your secret number "a" and your friend's secret number "b.".
- ## Step 3: Calculations

  Now, both you and your friend independently perform some simple calculations. You each do the following:

  - Take the public numbers (P and G) and raise them to the power of your secret number:

    - You calculate (G^a) mod P.

    - Your friend calculates (G^b) mod P.

- ## Step 4: Exchange Results

  You and your friend exchange the results of your calculations (the numbers you got after doing the exponentiation in Step 3).

- ## Step 5: Shared Secret 5.

  Finally, you and your friend take the number you received from each other and raise it to the power of your own secret number:

  - You calculate (friend's number^a) mod P.

  - Your friend calculates (your number^b) mod P.

- ## Step 6: The Magic
  Here's the magic: Even though you and your friend used different secret numbers (a and b), you will both end up with the same final result. This result is a shared secret key that only you and your friend know!

Now, you can use this shared secret key to encrypt and decrypt your messages. Even if someone intercepts the public numbers, the calculations, or the exchanged results, they won't be able to figure out your secret key because it was never sent over the network.
